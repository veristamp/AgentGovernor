# context7.resolve-library-id

> Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.

## Signature

```python
await resolve-library-id(query: str, libraryName: str)
```

## Description

Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.

You MUST call this function before 'query-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.

Selection Process:
1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for
2. Return the most relevant match based on:
- Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
- Description relevance to the query's intent
- Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
- Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative)
- Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)

Response Format:
- Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section
- Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen
- If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one
- If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements

For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.

IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best result you have.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | ✓ | The user's original question or task. This is used to rank library results by relevance to what the user is trying to accomplish. IMPORTANT: Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, or personal data in your query. |
| `libraryName` | string | ✓ | Library name to search for and retrieve a Context7-compatible library ID. |

## Usage Example

```python
result = await context7_binding.resolve-library-id(
    # Add parameters here
